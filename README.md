# dg

Dragging disappearing circles for my kid (clojurescript/pixijs/touch events).

## How to run this?

`lein figwheel` and use chrome's mobile view to enable touch events (or open in your mobile phone - you can put them under the same wifi and use your computer's IP with port 3449).

## Just show me

## I wanna see it fully working on mobile

You'll need an Expo Client to run this, but it's published and all (if you're on iOS, my password is "seriouslyapple?" - https://blog.expo.io/upcoming-limitations-to-ios-expo-client-8076d01aee1a). Check https://github.com/fenoloftaleina/dg-expo-container for details about how the native app was created.
